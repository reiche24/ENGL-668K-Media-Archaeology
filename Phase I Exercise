There are six antique computers set up for you to experiment with at MITH. In this, Phase I of the Media Archaeology module, you will learn basic facts about the pedigree of each, figure out how to turn it on (not always obvious!), and perform a few simple tasks to get a feel for how it works. You will work individually for this first phase of the module, logging your activity with each machine via GitHub. (Feel free to ask a classmate for help if you’re genuinely stuck on something, but only after you’ve made an honest effort on your own.) 

For the second phase of the module (to be distributed) you will work in pairs or small groups, choosing one or two computers for a more detailed exploration which may involve building or making something with its original software, and/or doing deeper historical and analytical work. 

You will generally have access to the computers any time MITH is open to the public, which is Mon-Fri, 9-5. Feel free to contact me with any logistical or technical problems. Phase I of this module is due by October 27.

*** Safe Handling ***

Some of these computers are more than three and a half decades old! They built ‘em strong back then so you don’t have to handle them with kid gloves, but please do treat the hardware with respect. To that end:

•	Absolutely no food or drink on the tabletop.
•	Some of the plugs and connections holding everything together are loose or delicate. If a machine doesn’t turn on check that all of its components are snugly plugged and connected, and that there is power going to it. Use common sense to try troubleshooting.
•	Never force anything. If something doesn’t seem to want to work or go or bend or fit, leave it be and ask me.
•	Please keep fingers off of the recording surface of the diskettes. Also keep magnets away!
•	All of the computers except the two Macs can simply be switched off at any point (though you will lose your work unless it’s been saved to a disk). The Macs should always be shut down using the appropriate option under the “Special” heading of the home menu (top of screen).
•	When you turn a computer off, wait about 10 seconds before turning it back on.
•	Please neaten up the workspace around each computer when you finish. Return diskettes to sleeves and holders, stack any books in an orderly fashion, etc.
•	Above all: please remember to turn these computers OFF when you are done with them. Remember, the learning experience for everyone starts with figuring out how to turn them on! Moreover, they won’t go to “sleep” on their own, and whatever is left of their lifespan will be diminished if they are left running.

*** The Exercise ***

For each computer, answer the questions and perform the tasks indicated. Feel free to consult any reference sources you spot around MITH (check the spline!), and/or Wikipedia or other online sources.

Make some additional notes below about each machine as you go: What’s the most notable difference from a computer that you’re used to? Can this computer and its software do anything that your current computer cannot?

KAYPRO 4

•	What year was it made? 
1984
•	What operating system does it run? 
MS-DOS
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
Then: $1,800    Now: $3,300   Found on both ebay and craigslist - seem to be quite a few in good working condition
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
The Kaypro 4 was a popular model because it had a larger display screen than it's competitor, the Osborne, it was considered
inexpensive for the time, and it came bundled with some of the software that was most commonly used. It was also an improvement over the
original Kaypro models as it had two ports for floppy disks. I found the Kaypro to be extremely frustrating to work with. If I'm beinng
honest I couldn't figure out how to get WordStar to even start let alone try to type out a document on it. The keyboard functions
seemed pretty straight forward as they were laid out on the keyboard itself, but it seemed to me like I couldn't ge them to work
properly.

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Start WordStar (you must figure out how). Try typing a simple document, experimenting with some commands based on the keyboard template. (You don’t need to save your document.)

APPLE IIe

•	What year was it made? 
1983
•	What operating system does it run? 
DOS 3.3
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List).
Then:$1298   Now:$2841    Found on both ebay and craigslist
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
The Apple IIe was known for introducing a full keyboard and the ability to use lower case letters. It also added the ability to
navigate the curser using the arrow keys (still no mouse yet). It was also still extremely compatible with other versions of Mac's
but the cost was still pretty high. I also read that this version was considered more for home and educational use instead of 
business use which I thought was interesting. The tutorial you go through definitely gives it that "educational" feel but that's also 
because it was still a new technology. I did appreciate how conversational the tutorial was. It wasn't too formal or intimidating
and didn't make it feel "high tech" even though for the time it definitely was.

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Work your way through the Apple Presents Apple tutorial. Try a game or two. (If you can beat one of my high scores on Sea Dragon you’ll get a prize. Really!)

MACINTOSH SE

•	What year was it made? 
1987
•	What operating system does it run? 
DOS 3.3
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
Then: $3699.95   Now: $7102.08                 found on both ebay and craigslist
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
The Macintosh SE is best known for dealing with problems of expansion. It came with a second port for floppy disk's or an internal
hard drive. It was discontinued in 1990 and replaced by the Macintosh Classic which contained several improvements for a lower
cost. In addition to Deena Larsen's Marble Springs there was also Storyspace Reader, We Descend, and Miss Sing on this computer.
I liked working on this one as it felt the most familiar after working on the Kaypro 4 and Apple IIe since it had things such
as a mouse. I also found the hypertext programs to be pretty easy to navigate and they were definitely more developed than I 
was thinking they were going to be.


Turn it on (you must figure out how). Read some of Deena Larsen’s Marble Springs. Quit Marble Springs. What else is on this Mac?

VECTREX

•	What year was it made? 
1982
•	What operating system does it run? 
MOS 6522 Versatile Interface Adapter
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
Then: $199    Now: $470   Found it on eBay, but not so much on craigslist
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
The historical strengths of the Vectrex were that it used a vector based screen and also the introduction of 3-D images.
I found it interesting that the graphics still weren't in color but individual games came with colored overlay sheets to help
with that. The Vectrex failed commercially due to unforseen turns in the market, but it was still an interesting innovation
for the time. I think the designer's would have opted for the "vector" graphics because it creates a more "real" and interactive
experience for the player versus something like SeaDragon on the Apple IIe.

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Play MineStorm. Try another cartridge. Why do you think the designer’s would have opted for the “vector” graphics?

===================================================================================================================
AMIGA

•	What year was it made? 
1985
•	What operating system does it run? 
AmigaOS
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
Then: $1295 + $300 monitor    Now: $3847 (even more if you got an upgraded model)    hard to find on the secondhand market
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
The Amiga was originally advertised as a business computer but it came to be used primarily as a home computer used for games 
and it sold well as it was not as expensive as some counter part. However, it eventually couldn't keep up with development and
fell off the market. I liked using the Amiga but it did seem a bit clunky to me as far as navigating the windows on the screen
in the programs you were trying to use. I did really like the "Amiga Appetizer" disk though. I thought the different games functions
like the tiles were fun and I really thought the integration of a music program was interesting as well. It seemed to really be
trying to integrate a lot of funtions into one computer which I really appreciated. I can see what the name of the book was titled
"The Future Was Here."

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Try the demos. What else can it do? (Hint: try the “Amiga Appetizer” disk). Have a look at the Amiga magazines and the book, The Future Was Here.

MACINTOSH IIci

•	What year was it made? 
1989
•	What operating system does it run? 
DOS 6.0
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
Then: $6,700   Now: $11,550   could only find on ebay
•In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
The Macintosh IIci came with quite a few system updates that previous Mac computers were lacking to improve the overall 
experience of the system and it was one of the most popular and best-selling Mac systems as well. This was my favorite out of all
of the computers to explore I think mainly because it was the closest option to what I am most familiar with. I liked MS Word more
than WordPerfect I think once again because I was already familiar with the program so I found it easier to navigate. In addition
to these word processors this computer also had excel, page maker and mac draw loaded on it. I felt like this computer was nice in that
it seemed like one I could still use today, especially in regards to the word processors.

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Open WordPerfect. Open MS Word. Try typing a simple document in each. Which do you like better, and why? Open MacPaint. Try drawing something. (You don’t need to save any of your work from these applications.) What else is on this Mac? What can you learn about its past user(s)?
